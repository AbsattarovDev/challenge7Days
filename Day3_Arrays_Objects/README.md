# 📅 Day 3 - JavaScript Learning Challenge

## 📖 Topics Covered
Today, I focused on learning about Arrays and Objects in JavaScript. These are fundamental data structures for organizing and managing data.

### Arrays
- Basics of arrays
- Array methods: `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `find()`, `reduce()`, `includes()`, `sort()`, `splice()`
